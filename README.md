# Welcome To ICS!

Here are my homework handouts for ICS courses of SJTU SE. All labs get full grades, except for lab6 and lab9 (too pesky!!).

Always remember it's just reference, not the true answer. The code may be out of date as the lab documentations change. Therefore, you should think twice before merging my code into your work.

Good luck :)
